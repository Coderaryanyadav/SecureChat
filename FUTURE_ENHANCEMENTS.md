# GhostChat Strategic Roadmap: Oracle Edition

GhostChat has been forged into an elite, multi-dimensional ephemeral network. This document tracks its evolution from a secure engine to a global standard for private digital manifestation.

## ✅ Accomplished Milestones (v1.0 - v4.0)
*   **[REMOVED] Web3 Gateway**: Shifted from wallet-base to Pure Spirit Identity for maximum privacy.
*   **[DONE] Ghost Guide (Onboarding)**: Automated interactive orientation for new phantoms (CSS Fix Verified).
*   **[DONE] Abyssal Deletion (Black Hole)**: Intuitive drag-and-drop vanishing of message fragments.
*   **[DONE] Voice Fragments**: E2EE audio transmissions that self-destruct after playback.
*   **[DONE] Multi-Dimension Explorer**: Concurrent support for unlimited synchronous portals.
*   **[DONE] PFS Ratchet**: Unique cryptographic IV/Salt per transmission for perfect forward secrecy.
*   **[DONE] Spectral Bloom UI**: Council-approved 45px glassmorphism aesthetic.

## 🔮 Phase 5: The Quantum Frontier (Current Focus)
*   **Lattice-Guard (Visual Cryptography)**: Enhanced visual feedback for encryption strength and "Post-Quantum" thematic UI.
*   **Ghost Communities**: Encrypted organizational structures for private, large-scale groups within dimensions.
*   **Ephemeral Persistence (Irony)**: Optional "Glitch-mode" where messages survive only as long as the window is focused.
*   **Spectral Handshake**: Improved ZK-Password proofing to prevent brute-force on the portal entrance.

## 🛰️ Moonshot Goals
*   **Ghost Mesh**: A fully decentralized, serverless messenger using P2P WebRTC data channels.
*   **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: Integrating DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for total control over digital presence.
*   **Satellite Relay Bridge**: Integration with low-orbit satellite data for unblockable global transmissions.
