# GhostChat Strategic Roadmap

This document track the evolution of GhostChat from a student project to an elite ephemeral platform.

## ✅ Completed Enhancements
*   **[DONE] Admin Empowerment**: First spirit to join becomes the Admin with Kick/Wipe powers.
*   **[DONE] PWA Manifest**: Added manifest.json for mobile "Spirit App" installation.
*   **[DONE] Rate Limiting**: Integrated `slowapi` to prevent brute-force manifestation attempts.
*   **[DONE] Universal File Encryption**: Encryption support for any file type (📎).
*   **[DONE] Automatic Dimension Generation**: Added random room code generator to remove bias.

## 🔮 Next Phase: Spectral Advancements
*   **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: Implement the Double Ratchet Algorithm so compromised keys cannot decrypt past sessions.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Authentication**: Transition to SRP (Secure Remote Password) so the server never even sees hashed passwords.
*   **WebRTC P2P mesh**: Remove the central server as a relay, connecting phantoms directly.
*   **Invisible Mode**: Allow spirits to dwell in the room without appearing in the "Phantoms" list.
*   **Biometric Vault**: Lock the "Past Echoes" list behind FaceID/Fingerprint using the WebAuthn API.

## 🛰️ Web3 & Beyond
*   **Web3 Identity**: Metamask/Ethers.js integration for wallet-based manifestation.
*   **IPFS Storage**: Store encrypted ephemeral files on the InterPlanetary File System.
*   **Quantum Guard**: Transition to AES-256 and Lattice-based encryption to repel future quantum threats.
