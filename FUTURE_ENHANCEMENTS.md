# GhostChat Strategic Roadmap

GhostChat is evolving into the definitive, elite, and **intuitive** platform for ephemeral digital manifestations. This roadmap outlines our journey from a powerful engine to a seamless, Gen-Z approved experience.

## ✅ Completed Enhancements (v3.1)
*   **[DONE] Ghost Guide Onboarding**: Interactive first-time guide explaining "Dimensions" and "Encryption Seals" to eliminate user confusion.
*   **[DONE] Smart Manifestation (Auto-fill)**: Persistence of ghost handles and avatars via local storage to reduce login friction.
*   **[DONE] Contextual Help Triggers**: 'Help-circle' indicators throughout the UI providing instant clarity on security features.
*   **[DONE] Multi-Dimension Explorer**: Concurrent room support with a high-end, tabbed sidebar interface.
*   **[DONE] Panic Erase (Simultaneous)**: A single click to wipe all active dimensions and disconnect immediately.
*   **[DONE] Spectral Bloom UI (Refined)**: 40px glassmorphism, Outfit typography, and refined micro-interactions.

## 🔮 Phase 2: User-Centric Advancements
*   **Quick-Join QR Codes**: Generate a "bridge link" that auto-fills the Dimension ID and Encryption Seal for the recipient (Optional Seal sharing).
*   **Proximity Portal (Local Discovery)**: Use Bluetooth/mDNS to find other users in the same physical space for instant "incognito" local chats.
*   **Voice Fragments**: End-to-end encrypted voice notes that self-destruct after one play.
*   **Ghost Notifications**: Browser push notifications that use cryptic emoji titles to hide content from lock screens.
*   **Drag-to-Vanish**: Intuitive gesture to drag a message to a trash icon to instantly erase it for everyone.

## �️ Phase 3: Elite Cryptographic Guard
*   **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: Moving from static room keys to ephemeral session keys (Double Ratchet protocol).
*   **Zero-Knowledge Authentication**: Implementing SRP (Secure Remote Password) so the server never touches your secret key.
*   **Quantum Guard**: Preparing for the post-quantum era with NIST-approved lattice-based encryption (Kyber/Dilithium).

## 🌍 Social & Web3 Fusion
*   **Manifestation Wallets**: Metamask integration to prove identity via Ethereum/Solana addresses without revealing names.
*   **Ghost Communities**: Encrypted, hidden sub-directories for large-scale private organizations.
*   **On-Chain Integrity Proofs**: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to verify a message's origin without compromising anonymity.
