# GhostChat Strategic Roadmap

This document tracks the evolution of GhostChat into an elite, multi-dimensional ephemeral platform.

## ✅ Completed Enhancements
*   **[DONE] Multi-Dimension Explorer**: PHANTOMS can now dwell in an unlimited number of rooms simultaneously within a single session using the tabbed workspace.
*   **[DONE] Admin Succession**: If a room admin vanishes, the title and powers are automatically bequeathed to the next spirit in the list.
*   **[DONE] Portal Locking**: Admins can now seal a dimension, preventing any new spirits from entering until unsealed.
*   **[DONE] 0-Warning Architecture**: Entire backend and test suite optimized for Python 3.14+, achieving 100% test coverage with zero deprecation or runtime warnings.
*   **[DONE] Spectral Bloom UI**: A high-end, Apple-inspired aesthetic with multi-layered glassmorphism and dynamic radial gradients.

## 🔮 Next Phase: Spectral Advancements
*   **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: Implement the Double Ratchet Algorithm (Signal Protocol) for message-level non-repudiation.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Manifestation**: SRP (Secure Remote Password) protocol so the server never handles raw or hashed passwords during registration.
*   **Ghost Mesh (WebRTC)**: Peer-to-peer data channels to bypass the server relay entirely for message delivery.
*   **Encrypted Local Vault**: Persistent IndexedDB storage for "Past Echoes," locked behind the user's secret key.

## 🛰️ Web3 & Beyond
*   **Web3 Identity**: Metamask/Ethers.js integration for wallet-based manifestation.
*   **On-Chain Audit Hashing**: Cryptographic proving of message integrity using blockchain anchoring.
*   **Quantum Guard**: AES-256 and Lattice-based encryption to repel future quantum computational threats.
